# BouncyCat

The game starts at the main menu. From here the player can choose to play, change the game difficulty, or see the leaderboard.

In play mode, the player controls a hand with their mouse. The hand is used to bounce the cats away from the water below. 

There will be blocks with a fish inside, which the cat wants, so the player should bounce the cat toward these treats. Hitting a treat will increase the playerâ€™s score. 

There will also be blocks that appear that will serve as obstacles. The cat will also bounce away from these, making gameplay more difficult. 

To pause the game, the player can press the spacebar, which will take them to a pause page. They can then continue playing or go back to the main menu.

The leaderboard shows the top scores and it remains across games.
